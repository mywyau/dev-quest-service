Areas to Watch / Improve for Scalability
1. PostgreSQL (RDS) Bottlenecks
Single instance is okay for small-to-medium load, but:

If read traffic grows (e.g., listing quests, viewing profiles), consider read replicas.

If writes (e.g., quest submissions, XP updates) become a bottleneck, explore horizontal sharding or task queues.

Use connection pooling with Doobie, and avoid N+1 queries.

Regularly monitor CPU, IOPS, connections via CloudWatch.

2. Backend: Scala Typelevel Stack
fs2 / http4s / Doobie are efficient but resource-bound. Key ideas:

Use bounded thread pools and timeouts to avoid stalling.

Consider streaming endpoints (NDJSON / Server-Sent Events) for high-read workflows like real-time quest updates.

Use Redis to cache:

Quest lists

Frequent reads (e.g., user XP, recent completions)

Session/user state if not already

3. Nuxt 3 Frontend
Nuxt with CloudFront scales well, but:

Use ISR or SSG where possible to avoid SSR bottlenecks on Fargate.

Minimize client-side API calls to reduce backend load â€” cache on edge/CDN where appropriate.

If SSR is used, consider render caching or dedicated SSR workers.

ðŸ§± Suggestions to Future-Proof Scalability
Database:
Add read replica in RDS to offload read traffic.

Consider partitioning quest or XP-related tables if they grow fast.

Use Redis-based rate limiting or cache XP computations.

Backend:
Use Redis for distributed locks or deduplication if you expect high write contention.

Add metrics/log aggregation via CloudWatch or an ELK stack to spot slow endpoints.

Frontend:
If SSR demand grows, move Nuxt rendering to Lambda@Edge or separate compute from the backend service.

Use edge caching aggressively on CloudFront for anonymous or rarely-changing pages.

ðŸš¦ Conclusion: You're in a strong place already
Youâ€™re already:

Containerized and decoupled (Fargate)

Caching with Redis

On scalable AWS infra

Using a fast, async-safe Scala backend

Your next steps should focus on:

Scaling the database (read replicas, schema planning)

Monitoring (CloudWatch metrics, tracing slow queries)

Caching key reads (user dashboards, quest lists)

Evaluating SSR load if your frontend sees big traffic spikes
